# Image Processing

Image processing is a huge field and it's hard to cover everything in the book. So, in this chapter we cover the basics of image processing which is enough to automate various basic mobile games. We use MATLAB for implementing most of the image processing algorithms in this book but feel free to use any other software/package. 

In this chapter, we will start by covering the basics of what an image is. Then, we will go on to talk about various commands that are used in MATLAB. Finally, we will cover some important concepts of image processing that we generally use with the help of code.
