# Image Processing

Image processing is rapidly growing field with a wide range of applications. Have you seen Facebook auto detect the faces of people in images you upload? That's image processing. Have you seen various filters that can be applied on an image in Instagram? That's image processing. 

Image processing is also used in medical diagnosis, character recognition, robotic vision, emotion detection, etc., Image processing is a huge field and it's hard to cover everything in the book. So, in this chapter we cover the basics of image processing which is enough to automate various basic mobile games. We use MATLAB for implementing most of the image processing algorithms in this book but feel free to use any other software/package. 

In this chapter, we will start by covering the basics of what an image is. Then, we show the various commands that are used in MATLAB and their outputs. We will also cover some important concepts of image processing used in game automation with the help of code.
