## Image Processing Techniques

We will use MATLAB for learning image processing but feel free to use other softwares if you have experience with them. MATLAB is very easy to learn and use but it's computationally intensive and slow. So, if for an application you need to process images faster, it's better to shift to C++ or Python and use image processing libraries such as OpenCV or PIL.

Now that you have understood the basics of what an image is, watch the first five videos "Image Processing in MATLAB" by The Motivated Engineer on YouTube. (optional)
