### What is Digital Image Processing?
Digital image processing is the use of computer algorithms to create, process, communicate, and display digital images. Digital images allows a much wider range of algorithms to be applied to the input data and can avoid problems such as the build-up of noise and signal distortion during processing. Since images are defined over two dimensions (perhaps more) digital image processing may be model in the form of multidimensional systems.

In this book, we use Digital Image Processing algorithms to :-
- Improve clarity and remove noise
- Extract the size, scale or number of objects in a scene
- Prepare images for display or printing
- Compress images for communication across a network

Mathematically we can say, an image processing operation typically defines a new image ‘g’ in terms of an existing image ‘f’. Or we can transform either the range of ‘f’.

*g(x,y) = t(f(x,y))*
