# Image Processing

We will use MATLAB for learning iamge processing but feel free to use other softwares if you have experience with them. MATLAB is very easy to learn and use but it's computational intensive and slow. So, if for an application you need to process images fasters, it's better to shift to OpenCV in Python.

Now that you have understood the basics of what an image is, watch the first five videos "Image Processing in MATLAB" by The Motivated Engineer on YouTube. (optional)

Digital image processing is the use of computer algorithms to create, process, communicate, and display digital images. Digital images allows a much wider range of algorithms to be applied to the input data and can avoid problems such as the build-up of noise and signal distortion during processing. Since images are defined over two dimensions (perhaps more) digital image processing may be model in the form of multidimensional systems.

In this book, we use Digital Image Processing algorithms to :-
- Improve clarity and remove noise
- Extract the size, scale or number of objects in a scene
- Prepare images for display or printing
- Compress images for communication across a network

Mathematically we can say, an image processing operation typically defines a new image ‘g’ in terms of an existing image ‘f’. Or we can transform either the range of ‘f’.

*g(x,y) = t(f(x,y))*
