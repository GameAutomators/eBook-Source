### Debugging in MATLAB

In this section, we will learn the basics of debugging and how we can debug in MATLAB.

#### What is Debugging?

Debugging is the process of stopping the execution of the code at a specific point so that you can analyse the state of the code there to find the mistakes. This is a very important feature of MATLAB that you have to understand and helps you save a lot of time while you have to find the mistake in your code. When the code stops the execution at a specific point, you can look at the values of all the variables there and see if everything's good.

#### Breakpoints

You can click on the margin left to the line numbers in MATLAB to create a breakpoint. The breakpoint is the point where you code stops executing.

You can see various features in MATLAB for debugging once you are at a break point.

Let's understand how each of these work now. 

##### Continue

Continue, as is name suggests, is used for continuing the execution of the code until the next breakpoint occurs.

##### Step

Step takes you to the next step of the code.

##### Step in

Step in takes you into the function in the line that you are executing now.

##### Step out

Step out bring you out of a function that you may have got into using step in.
