Developing skills through practical implementation has always fascinated learners with its outcome. A survey suggests that 50% of the general public play video games, and 10% consider them as serious gamers. They spend a lot of time in day playing video games- one of the main motivations being to make a high score. But what if we can apply the concepts we learnt to solve these mobile games? It will motivate more students to work on innovative ways to solve the games rather than spend hours trying to make high scores. Have you ever wondered if you can command your computer to play a game for you on your phone and then it actually ends up in making a world record? Sounds interesting right.

In this book, we will learn how to build algorithms and robots that can solve mobile phone games (especially Android) using concepts of electronics, image processing and machine learning.The Book simply aims at solving cum automating various easy to tough level android games with ample effort by the readers.

The book will give you a brief introduction of the tools and stuffs one needs to actually start working on the game automation and will lead you through series of steps followed and the challenges faced while working on any of your project.

 

Here are the kind of systems you will learn to build by the end of this book
* Arduino Plays Piano Tiles
* Arduino Plays Stick Hero
* Paper Toss Automated
* Arrows Automated
* Computer plays 3D Bowling
* Computer plays a Song
* Computer plays Find The Differences
