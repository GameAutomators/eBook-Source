# Introduction to Arduino

Arduino is an open-source platform used for building electronics projects. Arduino consists of both a physical programmable circuit board (often referred to as a microcontroller) and a piece of software, or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that runs on your computer, used to write and upload computer code to the physical board.

Jeremy Blum's Arduino tutorials on the YouTube are one of the best out there, watch the first three videos to get the basic understanding of Arduino.

##### Software
Arduino also has an open-source software component which is similar to C++. The Arduino integrated development environment (IDE) allows you to write code, compile it, and then upload it to your Arduino for stand alone use in prototyping and projects.
 A typical Arduino C/C++ sketch consist of two functions that are compiled and linked with a program stub main() into an executable cyclic executive program:

***setup()***: a function that runs once at the start of a program and that can initialize settings.

***loop()***: a function called repeatedly until the board powers off.

Sample program: (for blinking an LED)
```C
#define LED_PIN 13

void setup() {
    pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);       // Enable pin 13 for digital output
}

void loop() {
    digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH);    // Turn on the LED
    delay(1000);                    // Wait one second (1000 milliseconds)
    digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW);     // Turn off the LED
    delay(1000);                    // Wait one second
}
```
