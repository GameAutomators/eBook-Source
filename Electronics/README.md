# Electronics

In this chapter, we will cover the a brief introduction to electronics and an overview of the microcontroller Arduino and how it can be used to solve the mobile games. We will also learn various sensors that can used to detect what's on the screen and different ways of automating the touch.

We used Arduino in this book for the projects because it is easy to setup and use. Feel free to use the microcontroller that you are comfortable with.
