### Tutorial

#### Step 1: Using ADB Tool to capture screenshot

The following command instantaneously takes the screenshot of the connected device and stores it in the SD card following the specified path.
  
  ```MATLAB                     
system(' adb shell screencap -p /sdcard/screen.png ');
```       

The following command pulls it from the SD card of the android device into the working system following the path specified.

```MATLAB
system(' adb pull /sdcard/screen.png ');
  ```
  
The pulled image is stored in the form of a matrix of pixel values by the MATLAB.
                
                
#### Step 2: Image processing

Once the screenshot is obtained, smallest unit box is been croped out for recognization of number on it , using "ocr" command, and recognized number  is been stored in matrix.

#### Step 3: Algorithm

The algorithm is Expectimax, it gives approximate move which may lead to high score.ou algo is going to the depth of 6, precision of output depends directly on depeth of search in expectimax algo.
The code is written in c++ . It takes command line string input and return string output using following commands.

```
%  s is input string.
cmd = 'two048.exe ';
[status,out] = system([cmd s]);
```

#### Step 4: Using ADB Tool to simulate touch

The following command is used to swipe left, right,up or down. 
taking  (x,y) as a centre.
Chose a point on the which side u want to swipe. lets say (x1,y1) left swipe

```MATLAB
system(' adb shell input swipe x y x1 y1 ');
```
